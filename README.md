A Music Player lets you manage and listen to all your music files quickly and easily. In this article, I will take you through how to create a Music Player GUI with Python.

Technologies
The first step is to choose a Python GUI framework, here I had used two main GUI libraries for creating a music player with Python 
1.	Pygame
2.	tkinter

Functionality
1.	Tkinter is a library for creating GUI applications. Here we don’t need to use much functions of it we just need to use the askdirectory() method of Tkinter and other methods that you will see in the code section below.
2.	Then we will create functions such as play, stop, pause and resume in order to control the music player. To create these commands, we’ll build some functions and we’ll use Tkinter to create the button in the interface.

Result
Now you have your own music player and you can listen to songs using this app. Also, I think that creating such apps like a music player or other apps that you can use in your daily life can really help you get to know new Python frameworks
